# D-Data-sciePersonal-Key-Indicators-of-Heart-Disease
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing personal health information to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. Using statistical analysis and machine learning models, the project aims to identify key personal health indicators that are strongly associated with the risk of developing heart disease.


To explore and model the relationship between personal health metrics and the presence of heart disease, and to build a predictive model that can help identify high-risk individuals.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset typically includes the following features:

BMI (Body Mass Index)
Smoking (Yes/No)
Alcohol Drinking (Yes/No)
Stroke (Yes/No)
Physical Health (Number of unhealthy days)
Mental Health (Number of unhealthy days)
DiffWalking (Difficulty walking)
Sex
Age Category
Race
Diabetic (Yes/No/Borderline)
Physical Activity
GenHealth (General health)
Sleep Time
Asthma
Kidney Disease
Skin Cancer
Heart Disease (Target variable)

Key Steps Involved:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling missing values and duplicates
Encoding categorical variables
Normalizing/standardizing features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understanding data distributions
Visualizing correlations between features and heart disease
Detecting outliers
Feature Selection
Identifying the most important indicators using correlation, mutual information, or model-based importance

Model Building
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or XGBoost
Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Insights & Recommendations

Highlighting key risk factorsInterpreting model results for better health decision-making

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Optional: Streamlit or Power BI for interactive dashboards

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how personal health data can be used to assess the risk of heart disease. It provides both technical modeling and actionable health insights, which can be beneficial for preventive healthcare planning.
